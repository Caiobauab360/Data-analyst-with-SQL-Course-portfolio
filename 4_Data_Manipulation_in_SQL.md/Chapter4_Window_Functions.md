# Window Functions

**Chapter description:**

You will learn about window functions and how to pass aggregate functions along a dataset. You will also learn how to calculate running totals and partitioned averages.

# It's OVER

**Personal notes:**

Window functions are a class of functions that perform calculations on a set of results that has already been generated, also known as a "window." You can use window functions to perform aggregated calculations without having to group your data, as was done in subqueries within the SELECT statement. They can also be used to calculate information such as running totals, rankings, and moving averages.

**Example 1: Comparing with Overall Average*

Let's revisit the question from chapter 2: "How many goals were scored in each match in 2011/2012, and how does it compare to the overall average?" Instead of using a subquery in SELECT, we can calculate the overall average of goals and compare each match using the OVER() clause. This simplifies the syntax and improves processing time:

```sql
SELECT
	date,
	(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
	AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
FROM match
WHERE season = '2011/2012';
```

The results are identical to the approach with a subquery in SELECT from chapter 2, but the syntax is more straightforward, and the processing time is faster.

**Example 2: Creating a Ranking (RANK)*

The RANK clause creates a column numbering in the dataset, from highest to lowest or vice versa, based on a specified column. Let's use the same query from the previous example to answer the question: "What is the ranking of matches based on the number of goals scored?":

```sql
SELECT
	date,
	(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
	RANK() OVER (ORDER BY home_goal + away_goal) AS goals_rank
FROM match
WHERE season = '2011/2012';
```

By default, the RANK function orders the results and ranks them from the smallest to the largest value. If we want to reverse the order and rank the results from largest to smallest, we can add the DESC function:

```sql
SELECT
	date,
	(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
	RANK() OVER (ORDER BY home_goal + away_goal DESC) AS goals_rank
FROM match
WHERE season = '2011/2012';
```

**Key Differences:*

- Window functions are processed after the entire query, except for the final ORDER BY statement.
- They use the result set to calculate information instead of directly accessing the database.
- Window functions are available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, but not in SQLite.

**Exercises:**

**The match is OVER**

The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include with it that we will cover later on in this chapter.

In this exercise, you will revise some queries from previous chapters using the OVER() clause.

**Instructions:**

- Select the match ID, country name, season, home, and away goals from the match and country tables.

- Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function.

        SELECT 
            -- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
            m.id, 
            c.name AS country, 
            m.season,
            m.home_goal,
            m.away_goal,
            -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
            AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;

**What's OVER here?**

Window functions allow you to create a RANK of information according to any variable you want to use to sort your data. When setting this up, you will need to specify what column/calculation you want to use to calculate your rank. This is done by including an ORDER BY clause inside the OVER() clause. Below is an example:

SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal) AS rank
FROM match;
In this exercise, you will create a data set of ranked matches according to which leagues, on average, score the most goals in a match.

**Instructions:**

- Select the league name and average total goals scored from league and match.

- Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.

- Order the rank by the average total of home and away goals scored.

        SELECT 
            -- Select the league name and average goals scored
            l.name AS league,
            AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
            -- Rank each league according to the average goals
            RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
        FROM league AS l
        LEFT JOIN match AS m 
        ON l.id = m.country_id
        WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
        GROUP BY l.name
        -- Order the query by the rank you created
        ORDER BY league_rank;

**Flip OVER your results**

In the last exercise, the rank generated in your query was organized from smallest to largest. By adding DESC to your window function, you can create a rank sorted from largest to smallest.

SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal DESC) AS rank
FROM match;

**Instructions:**

- Complete the same parts of the query as the previous exercise.

- Complete the window function to rank each league from highest to lowest average goals scored.

- Order the main query by the rank you just created.

        SELECT 
            -- Select the league name and average goals scored
            l.name AS league,
            AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
            -- Rank leagues in descending order by average goals
            RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) DESC) AS league_rank
        FROM league AS l
        LEFT JOIN match AS m 
        ON l.id = m.country_id
        WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
        GROUP BY l.name
        -- Order the query by the rank you created
        ORDER BY league_rank;

# OVER with a PARTITION

**Personal notes:**

An important statement you can add to your OVER clause is PARTITION BY. It allows you to calculate separate values for different categories established in a partition. This is a way to compute different aggregated values within a column of data and apply them to a dataset, rather than having to calculate them in different columns.

**PARTITION syntax*

Just like before, use an aggregate function to calculate, such as AVG of the home_goal column. Then add the OVER clause afterward and inside the parentheses, indicate PARTITION BY, followed by the column by which you want to partition the average. This will return the overall average for, or PARTITION BY, each season.

```sql
AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season)
```

**Example: Expanding the Question*

Using the query from the previous lesson, answering the question "How many goals were scored in each match, and how does it compare to the overall average?". This is done using the OVER clause, and the query returns the date, goals scored, and the overall average. Let's expand the previous question and, instead, ask "How many goals were scored in each match, and how does it compare to the season average?". We can do this by adding a PARTITION BY clause to the OVER clause from the previous slide:

```sql
SELECT
	date,
	(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
	AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_avg
FROM match;
```

Specifying "PARTITION BY season" returns the average for each season on each row, according to the season to which each record belongs.

**PARTITION BY multiple columns*

You can also use PARTITION to calculate values split across multiple columns. In the following query, the OVER clause contains two columns to partition the AVG goals scored â€“ season and country. The result set returns the average of goals scored per season and country.

```sql
SELECT
	c.name,
	m.season,
	(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,
	AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY m.season, c.name) AS season_ctry_avg
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id;
```

**PARTITION BY considerations*

You can partition calculations by 1 or more columns as needed to answer a question you might have. Additionally, you can use PARTITION with any type of window function.

**Exercises:**

**PARTITION BY a column**

The PARTITION BY clause allows you to calculate separate "windows" based on columns you want to divide your results. For example, you can create a single column that calculates an overall average of goals scored for each season.

In this exercise, you will be creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League), the top ranked team in Poland, and comparing their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

Where do you see more outliers? Are they Legia Warszawa's home or away games?

**Instructions:**

- Complete the two window functions that calculate the home and away goal averages. Partition the window functions by season to calculate separate averages for each season.

- Filter the query to only include matches played by Legia Warszawa, id = 8673.

        SELECT
            date,
            season,
            home_goal,
            away_goal,
            CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
                ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
            -- Calculate the average goals scored partitioned by season
            AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_homeavg,
            AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_awayavg
        FROM match
        -- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
        WHERE 
            hometeam_id = 8673 
            OR awayteam_id = 8673 
        ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;

**PARTITION BY multiple columns**

The PARTITION BY clause can be used to break out window averages by multiple data points (columns). You can even calculate the information you want to use to partition your data! For example, you can calculate average goals scored by season and by country, or by the calendar year (taken from the date column).

In this exercise, you will calculate the average number home and away goals scored Legia Warszawa, and their opponents, partitioned by the month in each season.

**Instructions:**

- Construct two window functions partitioning the average of home and away goals by season and month.

- Filter the dataset by Legia Warszawa's team ID (8673) so that the window calculation only includes matches involving them.

        SELECT 
            date,
            season,
            home_goal,
            away_goal,
            CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
                ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
            -- Calculate average goals partitioned by season and month
            AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
                    EXTRACT(month FROM date)) AS season_mo_home,
            AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
                    EXTRACT(month FROM date)) AS season_mo_away
        FROM match
        WHERE 
            hometeam_id = 8673
            OR awayteam_id = 8673
        ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;

# Sliding windows

**Personal notes:**

In addition to calculating aggregate and ranking information, window functions can also be used to compute information that changes with each subsequent row in a dataset. Sliding windows are functions that perform calculations relative to the current row of a dataset. You can use sliding windows to compute a wide range of information that aggregates over a single row in your datasetâ€”performing totals, sums, counts, and averages in any order you need. A sliding window calculation can also be partitioned by one or more columns, similar to a regular window.

**Sliding Window Keywords*

A sliding window function contains specific keywords within the OVER clause to specify the data you want to use in your calculations. The general syntax uses the phrase ROWS BETWEEN to indicate that you plan to slice information in your window function for each row in the dataset, and then you specify the starting and ending point of the calculation.

```sql
ROWS BETWEEN <start> AND <finish>
```

To start and finish your ROWS BETWEEN statement, you can specify several keywords, as shown below:

- `PRECEDING`
- `FOLLOWING`
- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
- `CURRENT ROW`

`PRECEDING` and `FOLLOWING` are used to specify the number of rows before or after the current row that you want to include in a calculation. `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` and `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` tell SQL that you want to include every row from the beginning or end of the dataset in your calculations. Finally, `CURRENT ROW` tells SQL that you want to stop your calculation at the current row.

**Sliding Window Example*

The sliding window in this query includes several important pieces of information in its calculation. It first states that the goal is to calculate a sum of goals scored when Manchester City played as the home team during the 2011/2012 season. It then informs that you want to turn this calculation into a running total, ordered by the match date from oldest to newest and calculated from the beginning of the dataset up to the current row.

```sql
SELECT
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 
		UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM match
WHERE hometeam_id = 8456 AND season = '2011/2012';
```

Your resulting dataset has a column calculating the total number of goals scored throughout the season, with a final total listed on the last row.

**Sliding Window Frame*

Using the `PRECEDING` statement, you can also calculate sliding windows with a more limited frame. For example, the query below is similar to the previous one, with a slightly modified sliding window. The phrase `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` is replaced with `1 PRECEDING`, which calculates the sum of goals for Manchester City in the current and previous match.

```sql
SELECT
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 
		1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS last2
FROM match
WHERE hometeam_id = 8456 AND season = '2011/2012';
```

**Exercises:**

**Slide to the left**

Sliding windows allow you to create running calculations between any two points in a window using functions such as PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, and CURRENT ROW. You can calculate running counts, sums, averages, and other aggregate functions between any two points you specify in the data set.

In this exercise, you will expand on the examples discussed in the video, calculating the running total of goals scored by the FC Utrecht when they were the home team during the 2011/2012 season. Do they score more goals at the end of the season as the home or away team?

**Instructions:**

- Complete the window function by:

- Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.

- Assessing the running average of home goals scored.

- Ordering both the running average and running total by date.

        SELECT 
            date,
            home_goal,
            away_goal,
            -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
            SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total,
            AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_avg
        FROM match
        WHERE 
            hometeam_id = 9908 
            AND season = '2011/2012';

**Slide to the right**

Now let's see how FC Utrecht performs when they're the away team. You'll notice that the total for the season is at the bottom of the data set you queried. Depending on your results, this could be pretty long, and scrolling down is not very helpful.

In this exercise, you will slightly modify the query from the previous exercise by sorting the data set in reverse order and calculating a backward running total from the CURRENT ROW to the end of the data set (earliest record).

**Instructions:**

- Complete the window function by:

- Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.

- Assessing the running average of home goals scored.

- Ordering both the running average and running total by date, descending.

        SELECT 
            -- Select the date, home goal, and away goals
            date,
            home_goal,
            away_goal,
            -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
            SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
                ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_total,
            AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
                ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_avg
        FROM match
        WHERE 
            awayteam_id = 9908 
            AND season = '2011/2012';

# Bringing it all together

**Exercises:**

**Setting up the home team CTE**

In this course, we've covered ways in which you can use CASE statements, subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions in your queries to structure a data set that best meets your needs. For this exercise, you will be using all of these concepts to generate a list of matches in which Manchester United was defeated during the 2014/2015 English Premier League season.

Your first task is to create the first query that filters for matches where Manchester United played as the home team. This will become a common table expression in a later exercise.

**Instructions:**

- Create a CASE statement that identifies each match as a win, lose, or tie for Manchester United.

- Fill out the logical operators for each WHEN clause in the CASE statement (equals, greater than, less than).

- Join the tables on home team ID from match, and team_api_id from team.

- Filter the query to only include games from the 2014/2015 season where Manchester United was the home team.

        SELECT 
            m.id, 
            t.team_long_name,
            -- Identify matches as home/away wins or ties
            CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
                ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
        FROM match AS m
        -- Left join team on the home team ID and team API id
        LEFT JOIN team AS t 
        ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
        WHERE 
            -- Filter for 2014/2015 and Manchester United as the home team
            season = '2014/2015'
            AND t.team_long_name = 'Manchester United';

**Setting up the away team CTE**

Great job! Now that you have a query identifying the home team in a match, you will perform a similar set of steps to identify the away team. Just like the previous step, you will join the match and team tables. Each of these two queries will be declared as a Common Table Expression in the following step.

The primary difference in this query is that you will be joining the tables on awayteam_id, and reversing the match outcomes in the CASE statement.

When altering CASE statement logic in your own work, you can reverse either the logical condition (i.e., home_goal > away_goal) or the outcome in THEN -- just make sure you only reverse one of the two!

**Instructions:**

- Complete the CASE statement syntax.

- Fill out the logical operators identifying each match as a win, loss, or tie for Manchester United.

- Join the table on awayteam_id, and team_api_id.

        SELECT 
            m.id, 
            t.team_long_name,
            -- Identify matches as home/away wins or ties
            CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
                ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
        -- Join team table to the match table
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN team AS t 
        ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
        WHERE 
            -- Filter for 2014/2015 and Manchester United as the away team
            season = '2014/2015'
            AND t.team_long_name = 'Manchester United';

**Putting the CTEs together**

Now that you've created the two subqueries identifying the home and away team opponents, it's time to rearrange your query with the home and away subqueries as Common Table Expressions (CTEs). You'll notice that the main query includes the phrase, SELECT DISTINCT. Without identifying only DISTINCT matches, you will return a duplicate record for each game played.

Continue building the query to extract all matches played by Manchester United in the 2014/2015 season.

**Instructions:**

- Declare the home and away CTEs before your main query.

- Join your CTEs to the match table using a LEFT JOIN.

- Select the relevant data from the CTEs into the main query.

- Select the date from match, team names from the CTEs, and home/ away goals from match in the main query.

        -- Set up the home team CTE
        WITH home AS (
        SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
            CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
                ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
        -- Set up the away team CTE
        away AS (
        SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
            CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win' 
                ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
        -- Select team names, the date and goals
        SELECT DISTINCT
            m.date,
            home.team_long_name AS home_team,
            away.team_long_name AS away_team,
            m.home_goal,
            m.away_goal
        -- Join the CTEs onto the match table
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN home ON m.id = home.id
        LEFT JOIN away ON m.id = away.id
        WHERE m.season = '2014/2015'
            AND (home.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' 
                OR away.team_long_name = 'Manchester United');

**Add a window function**

Fantastic! You now have a result set that retrieves the match date, home team, away team, and the goals scored by each team. You have one final component of the question left -- how badly did Manchester United lose in each match?

In order to determine this, let's add a window function to the main query that ranks matches by the absolute value of the difference between home_goal and away_goal. This allows us to directly compare the difference in scores without having to consider whether Manchester United played as the home or away team!

The equation is complete for you -- all you need to do is properly complete the window function!

**Instructions:**

- Set up the CTEs so that the home and away teams each have a name, ID, and score associated with them.

- Select the date, home team name, away team name, home goal, and away goals scored in the main query.

- Rank the matches and order by the difference in scores in descending order.

        -- Set up the home team CTE
        WITH home AS (
        SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
            CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
                ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
        -- Set up the away team CTE
        away AS (
        SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
            CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win' 
                ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
        -- Select columns and and rank the matches by goal difference
        SELECT DISTINCT
            m.date,
            home.team_long_name AS home_team,
            away.team_long_name AS away_team,
            m.home_goal, m.away_goal,
            RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ABS(home_goal - away_goal) DESC) as match_rank
        -- Join the CTEs onto the match table
        FROM match AS m
        LEFT JOIN home ON m.id = home.id
        LEFT JOIN away ON m.id = away.id
        WHERE m.season = '2014/2015'
            AND ((home.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND home.outcome = 'MU Loss')
            OR (away.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND away.outcome = 'MU Loss'));
